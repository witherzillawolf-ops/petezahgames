## PeteZahGames — Copilot instructions for automated coding agents

These notes are targeted at AI coding agents (Copilot-style) to help you be
productive quickly in this repository. Keep changes conservative: prefer small,
well-scoped edits and preserve existing runtime behavior.

High-level architecture

- This is an Express-based web app (see `server.js`) that mainly serves static
  files from `public/` and exposes a few API endpoints under `/api/*`
  implemented in `server/api/*.js`.
- A lightweight HTTP "bare" router (from `@tomphttp/bare-server-node`) and
  related MercuryWorkshop transports (epoxy, bare-mux, scramjet, ultraviolet)
  are mounted to support proxying and service-worker-based proxy functionality.
  Look at `server.js` lines that mount `/bare/`, `/baremux/`, `/epoxy/`,
  `/scram/`, and the Scramjet service worker in `public/sw.js`.
- Supabase is used for auth/storage: see `server.js` and `server/api/*.js`.
  Environment variables `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, and `SESSION_SECRET` are
  required for auth flows.
- The app bundles many static pages and an iframe-driven UI under
  `public/pages/` and assets under `public/storage/`.
- Deployment templates and examples: `Dockerfile` (multi-stage),
  `cloudbuild.yaml`, `render.yaml`, `amplify.yml`, `netlify.toml`, `.replit`,
  `.gitpod.yml`, and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

Developer workflows & important commands

- Node engine: package.json declares `"type": "module"` and requires Node >= 22.
  Use pnpm when possible (project has pnpm manifests). Typical commands:
  - Development / run: `pnpm install` then `pnpm start` (Procfile runs
    `node server.js` directly; many platforms use `pnpm start`).
  - Build step: some deployment configs expect `pnpm build` (railway/netlify
    templates include `pnpm build`) but there is no `build` script in
    package.json—avoid adding one unless you implement a concrete bundling step.
    If you need to add a build script, document it clearly.
- Environment files: `.env.<NODE_ENV>` may be loaded. `vercel.json`, and
  `netlify.toml` include samples and required env vars. Do not commit secrets.
- If Agent Mode is in use for testing changes open a container using the
  provided Dockerfile

Project-specific conventions & patterns

- Static-first: prefer editing files in `public/` for UI changes. `server.js`
  only contains a small API and proxies; avoid changing static file paths unless
  you update `server.js` routes (e.g., `auth-callback.html`).
- Service-worker proxying: `public/sw.js` implements Scramjet service worker
  logic and exposes a message API for playground data. When modifying proxy
  behavior, verify both server bare routes and the service worker cooperate.
- External transports: The repository relies on packages from
  `@mercuryworkshop/*` and `@titaniumnetwork-dev/ultraviolet`. Changes touching
  transport integration must preserve the mounted static paths in `server.js`
  (e.g., `/scram/`, `/baremux/`, `/epoxy/`).
- Auth flow: `/api/signin`, `/api/signup`, `/api/set-session`, and OAuth
  endpoints in `server.js` use Supabase methods and express-session. When
  changing session handling, keep `req.session.user` and
  `req.session.access_token` semantics.

Integration points & external dependencies

- Supabase: check `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY` env vars and usage in
  `server/api/*.js`. Storage buckets (example: `profile-pics`) are referenced
  directly in the code.
- Third-party transports and libraries: `@mercuryworkshop/*`,
  `@titaniumnetwork-dev/ultraviolet`, and Scramjet are core to proxying. They
  expose file paths used by `express.static(...)` in `server.js`.
- External APIs: DuckDuckGo instant answers are used for search suggestions
  (`/results/:query`). Keep CORS and fetch handling robust.

Examples of typical edits to implement

- Add a new API route: prefer creating a new file in `server/api/` exporting a
  named handler (like `signin.js`) and wire it in `server.js` with
  `app.post('/api/your-route', yourHandler)`.
- Add a static page: place it under `public/pages/...` and link from
  `public/index.html` or add an iframe target. No backend changes required for
  simple pages.
- Change proxy routing: update `bare` routes or Scramjet config. If you change
  service worker behavior, update `public/sw.js` and static assets served under
  `/scram/`.

Safety and testing guidance

- When altering runtime behavior, run locally with `pnpm install` then
  `pnpm start` and visit `http://localhost:3000`. Use `NODE_ENV=development`
  when iterating on env file loading. Files and places to inspect when working
  on a change
- Core server: `server.js`
- API handlers: `server/api/*.js` (e.g., `signin.js`, `signup.js`)
- Static UI and assets: `public/` (especially `public/index.html`,
  `public/sw.js`, `public/pages/`, and `public/storage/`)
- Build and deployment hints: `package.json`, `Procfile`, `railway.json`,
  `vercel.json`, `netlify.toml`

Don'ts / gotchas

- Don't assume a `build` npm script exists; the repo is static-first and the
  start command runs the server directly.
- Avoid committing secrets or real Supabase keys. Use the provided placeholder
  envs in `railway.json`/`netlify.toml`.
- Service worker and bare routes are tightly coupled — changing one without the
  other may break proxying; update both and test.

If anything here is unclear or you want more detail about a specific component
(e.g., Scramjet integration, Supabase schema expectations, or deployment to a
specific provider), tell me which area and I'll expand the instructions or add
examples.
